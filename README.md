# entry-level-python
This is a repository that contains python projects I have built as an entry level learner;

It currently contains:
1. Temperature Converter
2. Calculator built using Tkinter
3. Password Generator

I will be updating it occassionally

PS: Some of these projects will be built with specific modules so you need to have those modules installed in order to run those files
